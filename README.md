# @realGrickiTop

Created as a joke, [@realGrickiTop](https://twitter.com/realGrickiTop) is a Twitter bot that posts random tweets around noon in Croatia imitating [Griƒçki top cannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotr%C5%A1%C4%8Dak_Tower).

Created for [Python Hrvatska meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Python-Hrvatska/events/242639630/) held on September 12, 2017 when I gave [a talk](https://mislavcimpersak.github.io/serverless-talk/) on serverless technology.

## Running your own

Project uses [Zappa](https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa/) and makes use of it's nifty feature of storing credentials in an S3 bucket.

So if you are planning to run your own create `secrets.json` locally based on [secrets_example.json](secrets_example.json) and upload it to your bucket.
